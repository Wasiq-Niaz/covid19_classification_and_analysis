# COVID-19 Classification (ML Project)

A machine learning project that preprocesses COVID-19 patient data, performs exploratory analysis, and trains an SVM model to classify outcomes.
The workflow includes data cleaning, encoding, train-test split, K-Fold validation, and final model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
